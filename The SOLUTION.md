# **<u>*The SOLUTION*</u>**

#### MY IDEA

## **HOW DOES IT WORK?**

My app will offer opportunities to students to donate and collect books from the hub of the respective school, thus making study easier for children who cannot  afford books due to high costs. Alternatively, any one can drop a line and ask to borrow books for up to 3 months. 

This app will allow you to donate your old books which are no longer of your use, but can help someone in need. The books donated must be under the conditions described, such as :

1. Not more than 2-3 years old
2. Three images for description is mandatory and more 

As you can see in the 3rd prototype of the Donate Book section,  the donated book will then be sent to the particular school the student is in and will be stored there properly alternatively, any one can drop a line and ask to borrow free of cost. The books will be stacked according to the particular subject and class. 

All the donated books will be checked from both inside and outside and if the book is scribbled or doodled or torn or spoiled from inside, the particular book will not be accepted and will be sent for recycle. All the books will be kept in good condition. The student who wants to select and and receive can go to the BOOKMARKS and can put the particular book in the cart, and so when he/she reaches the school office, he/she will receive the book through authentication by school id card and/or OTP(one time password).

The donated books will be marked as 'available' on the app and will be filtered through class, subject, publication, condition, etc.


Benefits & USP:
 

Thus, this app will help us as students develop along with school, environment, and as country as a whole. Here, my primary motive is to help in the development and education of the students.


Future of the app: 

Growing this app further with more featuress, will serve as a mode for donation for uniforms, stationary and other essentials that can be donated for those in need and will help the youth plan a good future for them and the country :)

I hope this app may grow and serve the people and won;t be limited to just one country or social/man-made boundaries.
